Solid Principle,
Total 5 principle:

single responsibility principle:
    A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
Open Close principle:
    Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution principle:
    Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
Interface Segregation principle:
    A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
Dependency Inversion Principle:
    Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
